### Motivation
When trying to find potential testers for [shippil.xyz],(https://shippil.xyz) I spent a bunch of time copy pasting accounts and getting their emails. This will let you clip leads with a click of a button and export them as a CSV, lowering time per lead from ~2min to mere seconds.

### Setup and Usage
1. Go to extensions tab and activate "Developer Mode"
2. Click "Load Unpacked" and choose this folder
3. When on a GitHub repo, there will be an icon next to the repo name, click it to add a Lead
4. Open the Extension Popup and click export to CSV

### Future Updates
- check whether the owner is an organization
- also get the name of the lead
